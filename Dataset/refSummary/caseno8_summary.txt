(a) Public authority---

 

----Public authority was a body which had public or statutory duties to perform and which performed such duties and carried out its transactions for the benefit of the public and not for private gain or profit---Such an authority, however was not precluded from making a profit for the public benefit.

 

(b) Constitution of Pakistan---

 

----Art. 199---Constitutional petition before High Court by an employee of a statutory body--- Maintainability---Function test---Scope---Courts generally apply the function test to consider whether a statutory body was a person within the meaning of Art. 199 of the Constitution.

(c) Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance (XVII of 2000)---

 

----S. 2(c) [since repealed]---Constitution of Pakistan, Arts. 199(5) & 199(1)(a)(ii)---Constitutional petition before High Court by an employee of a statutory body---Maintainability---Question was as to whether a statutory body was a person within the meaning of Art. 199 of the Constitution---Function test--- Scope--- Employees of Pakistan International Airlines, House Building Finance Corporation, N.E.D University of Engineering and Technology and Pakistan State Oil Company were proceeded against under the Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance, 2000 and were awarded various penalties---Said employees filed constitutional petitions before the High Court against penalties awarded to them, which petitions were held to be maintainable on the ground that statutory bodies in question were persons within the meaning of Art. 199(5) of the Constitution---Legality---Keeping in view the statutes which established the statutory bodies in question and their functions, they were bodies performing functions, some of which were functions of the Federation/State and through the exercise of public power, said bodies created public employments---Said statutory bodies were therefore persons within the meaning of Art.199(1)(a)(ii) read with Art.199(5) of the Constitution---Actions or orders passed by statutory bodies in question which were violative of the statutes creating them or of the rules/regulations framed under such statutes, could be interfered with by the High Court under Art. 199 of the Constitution---Impugned judgment of High Court was not open to exception in circumstances---Appeal was dismissed by Supreme Court accordingly.

(d) Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance (XVII of 2000)---

 

----Ss. 2(c), 10 & 12 [since repealed]---Constitution of Pakistan, Arts.199(5) & 199(1)(a)(ii), 4 & 10A---Constitutional petition before High Court by employees of a statutory body---Maintainability---Employees of Pakistan International Airlines, House Building Finance Corporation, N.E.D University of Engineering and Technology and Pakistan State Oil Company were proceeded against by their respective departments under the Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance, 2000 and were awarded various penalties, against which they filed constitutional petition before the High Court---High Court held that constitutional petitions were maintainable on the ground that statutory bodies in question were persons within the meaning of Art.199(5) of the Constitution---Question was as to whether employees in question being persons in corporation service within the meaning of S.2(c) of Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance, 2000 and having been deprived of their right to appeal under S.10 of the said Ordinance because of the judgment in the case of Muhammad Mubeen-us-Salam and others v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Defence and others (PLD 2006 SC 602), could invoke Art.199 of the Constitution against order of departmental authority---Although rules/regulations of statutory organizations in question might have been non-statutory but there was a statutory intervention in the shape of Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance, 2000 and the employees had to be dealt with under the said law---Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance, 2000 had an over-riding effect and after its promulgation (27th of May 2000), all disciplinary proceedings which had been initiated under the said Ordinance and any order passed or action taken in disregard to the said law was amenable to constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court under Art. 199 of the Constitution---Legislative intent in the promulgation of Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance, 2000, inter alia, was that service matters for persons in corporation service should be dealt with in accordance with provisions of said law and to ensure a fair trial it was inter alia provided in the said Ordinance that unless specifically exempted by a reasoned order, the competent authority shall hold a regular enquiry against an employee accused of misconduct, and that he shall have a right of appeal (section 10 of the Ordinance)---Subsequently employees were deprived of their right of appeal as the same was held to be ultra vires of the Constitution by the Supreme Court in the cases of Muhammad Mubeen-us-Salam and others v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Defence and others (PLD 2006 SC 602), and Muhammad Idrees v. Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan and others (PLD 2007 SC 681)--- Deprivation of such right of appeal would amount to judicial sanctification of all orders passed by departmental authorities awarding various penalties to employees and would also be violative of fundamental right to fair trial and due process as ordained in Art. 10A of the Constitution---Employees in question could invoke Art. 199 of the Constitution to seek due compliance of Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance, 2000 in such circumstances---Impugned judgment of High Court was not open to exception---Appeal was dismissed accordingly.
