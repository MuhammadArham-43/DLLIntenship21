Malik UMAR ASLAM---Appellant
Versus
Mrs. SUMAIRA MALIK and others---Respondents
Civil Appeal No.669-L of 2013, decided on 28th October, 2013.
(Direct appeal under section 67(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 (Act No.LXXXV of 1976) against the judgment dated 5-4-2013 passed in Election Petition No.104 of 2008 by the learned Election Tribunal, Lahore.)
(a) Representation of the People Act (LXXXV of 1976)---

 

----Ss. 67(1A) & 67(1)---Interpretation of S.67, Representation of the People Act, 1976---Election Tribunal---Adjudication of Election petitions----Expeditious disposal of election petitions---Mandatory nature of S.67(1A) of the Representation of the People Act, 1976---Timely decisions were not being taken by the Election Tribunals; because, inter alia, Election Tribunals were ordinarily presided by Judges of the High Courts who remain unable to conclude matters expeditiously on account of their other judicial commitments, or because of delaying tactics employed by respondents who, having been declared as returned candidates, enjoyed the status of Members of the National or Provincial Assemblies---Such delays in disposal of election petitions before the Tribunal in fact deprived a large number of electors of the constituency to have their due representation in the elected Houses, particularly in those matters where a whole term had been enjoyed by a winning candidate, who may later turn out to be disqualified on any count---Such delay caused the people of constituency to be represented by a person who was not duly elected, which clearly negated the principle of a democratic system of Government---Wisdom existed in fixing the period for decision of such cases, namely, that there should be no uncertainty for the persons, who had been elected or who had challenged the election before the Tribunal or the Court and after expeditious disposal of the same and such persons should consume all their energies for the welfare of the people whom they represent, instead of wasting time in pursuing such matters before the Courts---Mandatory requirement of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 was that the Election Tribunal shall proceed with the trial of the election petition on a day-to-day basis and the decision thereof shall be taken within four months from its receipt as provided under S.67(1A) of the Act---Legal duty had, therefore, been cast upon the Election Tribunal to reach a conclusion expeditiously by following stringent/coercive measures of imposing a cost and assigning the reasons if cases were adjourned by the Tribunal and to such end, the Tribunal was even empowered to declare that a returned candidate who was delaying the proceedings of the Tribunal; ceased to be a member of the Parliament/Provincial Assembly, either till the conclusion of the proceedings or for such period as the Tribunal may direct---Provisions of S.67(1A) of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 were therefore mandatory in nature and entailed penal consequences for non-compliance.

(b) Civil Procedure Code (V of 1908)---

 

----Ss. 96, 104 & O.XLIII---Appeal---Appealable orders/decrees---Scope---Appeal was a statutory right, which would only be exercised if the statute had provided so as a matter of right---Under S.96, C.P.C. an appeal lay against all decrees passed by a court in exercise of original civil jurisdiction, except consent decree, and decree passed in a suit filed under S.9 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 and a final decree, the preliminary decree of which was not challenged--- Appeal also lay against an order if so provided for by S. 104 or O.XLIII, C.P.C.

 

(c) Administration of justice---

 

----Judicial adjudication had to be undertaken by a forum duly authorized to exercise judicial powers and pronounce judgment between the parties.

 

(d) Qanun-e-Shahadat (10 of 1984)---

 

----Art. 1(2) & Preamble---Domestic Tribunal etc.---Applicability of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 on proceedings before Domestic Tribunals, Inquiry Committees etc.---Scope---Domestic Tribunals, like inquiry committees, and departmental committees constituted statutorily by Universities to probe genuineness or otherwise of a degree, were bound by the principles of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984.

 

Rahat Naseem Malik v. President of Pakistan 2003 PLC (C.S.) 759 rel.

 

(e) Representation of the People Act (LXXXV of 1976)---

 

----Ss. 67(3) & 67(1)---Constitution of Pakistan, Arts. 62 & 63---Decision of Election Tribunal---Appeal to the Supreme Court---Adjudication of such appeal by the Supreme Court---Scope---Adjudication in appeal proceedings by the Supreme Court at the apex level was distinct and different from decision/findings of Domestic Tribunals, not because of hierarchy but because of the statutory powers available to an appellate court under S.67 of the Representation of the People Act, 1976---Adjudication of an issue, which was a continuous bone of contention between the parties could not be postponed even if there was a lapse of a period of 10 years ; and particularly when a candidate had to prove his/her credentials in terms of Arts. 62 & 63 of the Constitution to establish that no objection/attack was actionable against him or her, both before as well as after entering the Parliament or the Provincial Assembly---Court could intervene in the election of such candidates, who were found to be disqualified, even after having been elected as members of Parliament, and their election could subsequently be de-notified.

(f) Representation of the People Act (LXXXV of 1976)---

 

----Ss. 99(c) & 67---Constitution of Pakistan, Arts. 62 & 63---Conduct of General Elections Order (7 of 2002) Art. 8-A---Qanun-e-Shahadat (10 of 1984), Art. 84---Disqualification for membership of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament)---Educational degree obtained by forgery, impersonation or dishonest means---Inquiry by University as to the genuineness of degree--- Adjudication of appeal by the Supreme Court---Appreciation of evidence---Scope---Appellant had impugned decision of Election Tribunal whereby election petition filed by the appellant was dismissed---Appellant had asserted that the respondent, who had been declared as the returned candidate for his constituency, had obtained a B.A. degree through forgery and impersonation; and therefore her election as a member of the National Assembly be declared void---Contention of the respondent was, inter alia, that the University authorities, after holding of an inquiry, had come to the conclusion that the degree of the respondent was valid; and therefore no further inquiry was needed in the matter---Held, upon deep appreciation of evidence, both documentary and oral, made by the parties and through perusal of the judgment of the Election Tribunal; the University authorities failed to arrive at a correct conclusion in view of the evidence produced before them---Supreme Court, in circumstances, had to examine the documents independently under powers granted by Art.84 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984---Respondent, in order to make herself qualified for contesting elections in the year 2002 had arranged a B.A. degree by way of impersonation to fulfil the requirements of Art.8-A of the Conduct of General Election Order, 2002 and otherwise, after having passed intermediate examinations in the year 1981, there was no necessity for her to obtain B.A. degree---Contention that since there were allegations against the University, therefore, without impleading the same no finding could be recorded upon the genuineness of the degree, was not entertainable since there was always litigation between the parties in respect of validity and genuineness, of degree obtained by adopting illegal means including impersonation and a University, being a place of education, should not be dragged into litigation; as it is for the University to decide whether or not to take action against delinquents---Respondent, at the time when she filed nomination papers, was not qualified to contest the elections and had proved herself as not sagacious, righteous, non-profligate, honest and Ameen in terms of Art.62(1)(f) of the Constitution---Supreme Court observed that the respondent had not held the office of MNA from her constituency with lawful authority; as a disqualified person had no right to represent the electorate of the country and therefore, on account of such qualification the respondent would not be entitled to contest the election in future as well, and if she did contest elections and was declared successful, the Election Commission would be bound to de-notify her---From ab initio, when the respondent submitted nomination papers she was not qualified and she had proved herself not to be a truthful person---Supreme Court directed that the notification whereby the respondent was notified as the returned candidate be declared void and the respondent was declared as disqualified from becoming member of Parliament---Appeal was allowed, accordingly.
