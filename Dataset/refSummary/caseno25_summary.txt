2016 S C M R 816
[Supreme Court of Pakistan]
Present: Ejaz Afzal Khan, Sardar Tariq Masood and Faisal Arab, JJ
COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX, PESHAWAR---Appellant
Versus
Messrs ISLAMIC INVESTMENT BANK LTD.---Respondent
Civil Appeal No. 1086 of 2009, decided on 16th December, 2015.
(On appeal against the order dated 29-1-2009 passed by the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar in T.R. No. 48 of 2007)
(a) Interpretation of statutes---

 

----Repealed statute---Provisions of a repealed statute preserved by a saving clause in the repealing statute---When a statute repeals an earlier statute and it was an unqualified repeal, then the effect of such repeal was that the earlier statute got repealed in its entirety---However, where the Legislature intended to preserve any power or inchoate right in relation to the repealed statute, then a saving clause was incorporated in the repealing statute whereby certain provisions were preserved from getting repealed to the extent and with regard to the subject mentioned in the saving clause---Provisions of the repealed law that were so preserved were to be regarded as if the repealed statute was still in operation.

 

(b) Income Tax Ordinance (XLIX of 2001)---

 

----S. 239(1)---Income Tax Ordinance (XXXI of 1979) [since repealed], Preamble---Section 239(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 as a saving clause---Scope---Section 239 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, by its very nature, being a saving clause, was intended to preserve certain powers and procedures contained in the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979---Several procedures for the correct assessment of income and determination of tax liability were devised in the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979---Section 239(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, in fact saves the entire set of procedures prescribed under the repealed law [Income Tax Ordinance, 1979] through which the exercise of reaching at the correct calculation of total income and the tax payable thereon could be undertaken with regard to the periods covered under the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979---Section 239(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 encompassed within its ambit all types of assessments that could be made to a tax return---In simple terms, assessment was relatable to all stages of assessments that could be made to a tax return under the provisions of the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979---Replacement of old law with a new one was never intended to affect the right of the department to revise an assessment order that had been made under the provisions of the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, but was intended only to devise a new method and mechanism to determine income and the tax payable for the post repeal era---Hence, the whole purpose of incorporating S. 239 of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 was to preserve certain powers and procedures laid down in the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, so that it could be subsequently enforced in the post repeal era only in matters that related to the period covered under the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979.

 

(c) Income Tax Ordinance (XLIX of 2001)---

 

----Ss. 122(5A) & 239(1)---Income Tax Ordinance (XXXI of 1979), S.66A [since repealed]---General Clauses Act (X of 1897), S. 6---Original assessment order relating to period of repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 i.e. on or before 30-06-2002---Commissioner serving notice to tax-payer under S. 122(5A) of Income Tax Ordinance 2001, to amend such original assessment order---Legality---Sending of such notice under the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 was technical mistake as the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 was the applicable law for revising/amending such assessment---Section 239 of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, had preserved the powers of the tax authorities to amend assessments orders pertaining to the period falling under the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979---Notice for reopening/amending the assessment in the present case, thus, should have been issued under S. 66A of the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979---Supreme Court treated notice under S. 122(5A) of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 to be notice issued under S. 66A of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 and directed Commissioner, Income Tax (Appeals) to decide the appeal afresh.

 

Honda Shahrah-e-Faisal Association of Persons, Karachi v. Regional Commissioner of Income Tax, Karachi 2005 PTD 1316 not approved.

 

Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, stood repealed with effect from 30-06-2002 and was replaced by the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, which came into operation immediately thereafter i.e. with effect from 01-07-2002. Section 239(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, provided that any assessment that was to be made for the income years ending on or before 30-06-2002, the same had to be made under the provisions of the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, as if Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, had not come into force. The question that arose in the present case was whether the Commission Income Tax was justified in revising an assessment order relating to the period covered under the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, by invoking the provisions of section 122(5A) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, that was inserted on 01.07.2003 i.e. one year after the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, came into operation.

 

Provisions of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, could not be interpreted in a manner so as to take away the powers of the Taxing Authority to revise, within the prescribed period of time, any assessment order that was passed under the provisions of the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979.

 

Honda Shahrah-e-Faisal Association of Persons, Karachi v. Regional Commissioner of Income Tax, Karachi 2005 PTD 1316 not approved.

 

Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, had preserved the powers of the tax authorities to revise assessments orders pertaining to the period falling under the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, i.e. on or before 30-06-2002, and for such purpose Section 239(1) was incorporated in the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 as a saving clause. Additionally, assessments from period of repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 could also be revised/amended on the strength of the provisions of section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 as the charge of tax stood created, in the present case on or before 30.06.2002 thus transforming the State's right to claim tax into a vested right. Had the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, not come into existence, the assessment in the present case could have been amended under the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, within five years of its finalisation i.e. within five years from 14-5-2003, when the initial assessment order in the present case was passed. This right to revise the assessment in question could be exercised under the provisions of the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, uptill 13-05-2008 which right was never given up under any provision of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. In the present case, on the strength of section 239(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 the machinery provided under section 122(5A) of the same Ordinance, was brought into play to send a notice for the assessment year in question. This was only a technical mistake because in terms of section 239 (1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, notice for reopening the assessment in question should have been issued under section 66A of the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979. It thus did not follow that the notice was invalid under the law.

 

Supreme Court treated notice under section 122(5A) of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 to be notice issued under section 66A of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 and directed Commissioner, Income Tax (Appeals) to decide the appeal afresh.

 

(d) Interpretation of statutes---

 

----Amendment---Provision incorporated in a statute through an amendment that was procedural in nature---Retrospective rule of construction was to be applied to such provision---Such a provision had to be construed as if it was incorporated on the date when the main enactment reached the statute book.

 

(e) Income Tax Ordinance (XLIX of 2001)---

 

----S. 239(1) [as amended by the Finance Act, 2002]---Income Tax Ordinance (XXXI of 1979), Preamble [since repealed]---Retrospective effect of amended S. 239(1) of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001---Merely because the amended S. 239(1) was inserted in the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, on 01-07-2003 instead of 1-7-2002 when the parent statute i.e. Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 came into operation, it could not be said that a vacuum was created in giving effect to it from the date when the main enactment came into operation---By virtue of the amended S. 239(1), the powers or inchoate rights relating to income years covered under repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, to the extent mentioned in S. 239 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, were to continue to be exercised/enforced on the basis of the procedures prescribed in the repealed law as if the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 was still in operation---Provisions of S. 239(1) of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 applied retrospectively.

(f) Income Tax Ordinance (XLIX of 2001)---

 

----Preamble---General Clauses Act (X of 1897), S. 6---Liability to pay income tax---Accrued on the tax payer on the last day of the income year/accounting year creating a vested right in favour of the State---Provisions in income tax law relating to its assessment were thus machinery provisions only for the purpose of quantifying the liability to pay income tax, which liability had become absolute on completion of the income year/accounting year.

 

Liability to pay income tax accrues on the taxpayer on the last day of the income year/accounting year, though the tax became payable after it was quantified in accordance with the procedures laid down in the Income Tax law. Thus a vested right in favour of the State was created at the end of each accounting year, though the exercise of (i) making an assessment on the basis of ascertainable data of income and expenditure, or (ii) revising an assessment order where it was found that there was sufficient material to hold that the original assessment was prejudicial to the interest of the revenue, took place at some later stage. These procedural exercises were undertaken only with the object of reaching at the correct calculation of yearly income but the real liability to pay tax had already accrued on the last day of the income year i.e. on the last day of the accounting year thereby creating a vested right in favour of the State. It may be understood as an expense that has already accrued but was payable later. Thus provisions in income tax law relating to its assessment were machinery provisions only for the purpose of quantifying the liability. Seeking revision of a tax return at any subsequent stage had nothing to do with the creation of charge on the tax-payer that had become absolute on completion of the income year/accounting year.

(g) Companies Ordinance (XLVII of 1984)---

 

----S. 316---Suits stayed in winding up order---Scope---Section 316 of the Companies Ordinance, 1984, was attracted when winding up order was passed or provisional manager was appointed---Mere filing of winding up proceedings did not attract the provision of S. 316 of the Companies Ordinance, 1984.
