----Art. 371-A---Pensionary benefits---Government servants rendering temporary service in a temporary establishment for more than five years---Entitlement to grant of pensionary benefits within the meaning of Art.371-A of the Civil Service Regulations (CSR)---Scope-- Article 371-A of the Civil Service Regulations (CSR) would not ipso facto or simpliciter allow government servants rendering temporary service in a temporary establishment for more than five years to be entitled to grant of pension, rather such period would only be counted towards such government servants' pension if otherwise entitled to pension. Mir Ahmad Khan v. Secretary to Government and others (1997 SCMR 1477) declared to be per incuriam]

 

Service rendered for more than five years as contemplated by Article 371-A of the Civil Service Regulations (CSR) would only be added, included, or taken into account for the purposes of pensionary benefits, and not make such government servant qualify for pension per se. Article 371-A of Civil Service Regulations (CSR) by itself did not provide for the entitlement for the purposes of pension, rather, it was restricted to the counting of the period of a minimum of five years which had been rendered by the temporary employee that once he was appointed on a permanent basis, such period (of five years) shall be taken into account for the object of calculating his entitlement to pension with respect to the requisite minimum period under the law.

 

Mir Ahmad Khan v. Secretary to Government and others 1997 SCMR 1477 declared to be per incuriam

 

Article 371-A cannot be used as a tool to bypass the conditions for qualifying service of pensionary benefits, and such government servant had to fulfill the minimum number of years for grant of pension. This was due to the use of the word count as opposed to qualify or eligible in Article 371-A of the Civil Service Regulations (CSR).

 

It was absurd, ludicrous and inconceivable that a government servant, who was in regular employment, would become entitled to pension after serving the minimum years of qualifying service as prescribed by the law, whereas while interpreting Article 371-A of the Civil Service Regulations (CSR), a government servant who had served as a temporary employee could be given preference over a regular employee, and after a minimum service of only five years would automatically become entitled to pension. Holding so would be against the object and spirit of the concept of pension.
