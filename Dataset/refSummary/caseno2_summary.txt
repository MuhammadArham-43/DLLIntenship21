(a) Police Service of Pakistan (Composition Cadre and Seniority) Rules, 1985---

 

----R. 11(2)(c)---Police officers from the Provinces encadred into the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP)---Seniority---Scope---Rule 11(2)(c) of Police Service of Pakistan (Composition Cadre and Seniority) Rules, 1985, was confined to determination of seniority amongst the encadred police officers from the Provinces---Where question of seniority arose either between those coming from the same Province or between officers encadred from different Provinces the same would be determined in accordance with R. 11(2)(c) of the said Rules---Rule 11(2)(c) of the Rules was thus to be restricted only to the determination of seniority in the encadred group and could not be made applicable for determining their seniority vis-a-vis the other two groups (i.e. officers inducted into the Police Service of Pakistan through initial appointment and those appointed in the Police Service of Pakistan from the Armed Forces).

 

(b) Police Service of Pakistan (Composition Cadre and Seniority) Rules, 1985---

 

----Rr. 5, 7 & 11(2)(c)---Police officers from the Provinces encadred into the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP)---Not an initial appointment---Inter se seniority, determination of---Scope---For the purposes of determining inter se seniority of such encadred provincial police officers, their encadrement could not be considered as initial appointment---Initial appointment was confined to those officers appointed against a cadre post through competitive examination held by the Federal Public Service Commission.

 

(c) Police Service of Pakistan (Composition Cadre and Seniority) Rules, 1985---

 

----Rr. 7 & 11(2)(c)---Police officers from the Provinces encadred into the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP)---Seniority---Question as to whether seniority of such police officers was to be reckoned from the date when the vacancies occurred in the senior cadre reserved for that particular Province or from the date of notification of their encadrement---Ante-date encadrement of the Provincial police officers in the Police Service of Pakistan---Legality---Rule 7 of Police Service of Pakistan (Composition Cadre and Seniority) Rules, 1985 did not specifically mention retrospective appointment (ante-dated encadrement) of such officers from the date on which the vacancy arose in a Province---Use of the words shall be appointed to the service in said R. 7 indicated that the appointment of such police officers from the Province into the Police Service of Pakistan was to be with prospective effect and not retrospective effect---Retrospective effect could be given to such appointments only for the limited purpose of determining their own inter se seniority in accordance with R.11(2)(c) of the Police Service of Pakistan (Composition Cadre and Seniority) Rules, 1985---Notification whereby provincial police officers were appointed to Police Service of Pakistan retrospectively was declared to be in violation of R.7 of the Police Service of Pakistan (Composition Cadre and Seniority) Rules, 1985---Appeal was disposed of accordingly.
