(a) Interpretation of statutes--
----Fiscal statute --- Charging section, interpretation of --- Scope --- Charging section in a fiscal statute, demanded its strict interpretation and application in so far as the revenue was concerned, but where it was susceptible to two possible interpretations, it should be liberally construed in favour of the tax payer/citizen; particularly, where there was substantial doubt about the true import and application of a charging section---Such doubt should be resolved in favour of the tax payer/citizen.

(c) Transfer of Property Act (IV of 1882)---

(d) Administration of justice--

(e) Transfer of Property Act (IV of 1882)---

 

----S. 107---Registration Act (XVI of 1908), S. 49---Lease, registration of---Non-registration of lease---Effect---No lease could be effected beyond the period of one year except by a registered instrument and if any lease was not so accomplished, it had no legal validity and sanction beyond the period of one year and would neither create nor purport to create any lease for the period exceeding one year --- On account of such clear mandate and compulsion of law, no lease which was not in consonance with such provisions (i.e. not registered) could at all be said or held to be permanent in nature under any circumstances whatsoever.

 

(f) Transfer of Property Act (IV of 1882)---

 

----S. 107---Lease in perpetuity/ permanent lease---Nature and scope---Lease deed, interpretation of---Factors relevant for ascertaining whether a lease contract was in the nature of a permanent lease/lease in perpetuity elaborated by the Supreme Court---Were the language of the lease deed made it clear that the tenancy was for a fixed period of time, even if it (the deed) contained a clause for renewal, but such renewal was left at the option of the lessor, the lease could not be held to be permanent in nature---Fact that the lessee has been allowed to raise construction over the property of a permanent nature and to even sub-let/sublease the same, specifically where the same was subject to the consent/approval of the lessor, by itself shall not be a factor for holding a lease to be one in perpetuity---For construing a contract of lease in ascertaining its permanency or not, object for which the lease had been granted shall also be germane and important---Where a lease of the property had been given by the lessor to the lessee for a particular and a specific purpose, but no time was fixed, for all intents and purposes it shall be an object specific lease, which meant that the purpose/object should be considered as the time/period fixed by the parties for the determination of the lease, and thus the moment the purpose was achieved and accomplished, the purpose shall be held to have extinguished (come to an end)---Lease which at its very inception may have been perceived to have some overtones of permanency in its nature, regardless of whether a period had been fixed or not, such lease, even if construed to be permanent on the basis of its object/purpose, shall automatically come to an end when the object of the lease was extinguished, and even if the lessee under the terms of lease had raised construction, as such structure shall either be treated as an accretion to the original leased out property and would go to the lessor or the lessor would have to compensate the lessee for such construction (but this depended upon the facts and circumstances of each case and on the basis of the terms and conditions settled between the parties)---Once the purpose of the lease was finally achieved and the purpose for which the property was leased out came to an end, the lease which might have had some colours of perpetuity at its inception shall also end with it and the lease shall then be rendered to be that of holding over entitling the landlord to determine/terminate the lease and ask for the vacation of the leased property.

 

(g) [Sindh] Urban Immoveable Property Tax Act (V of 1958)---

 

----Ss. 3 & 4(a) & (b)---Transfer of Property Act (IV of 1882), S. 107--- Property tax---Evacuee Trust Property Board (Board), property of---Lease deed, interpretation of---Lease in perpetuity---Scope---Fixed term lease with return of property to Board (lessor) upon expiry of lease---Non-exemption from property tax---Property in question, which was owned by Evacuee Trust Property Board (Board), was leased out to lessee for 30 years, with the option to extend the lease by another 30 years on terms and conditions laid down by the Board---Provincial Property Tax Department (Tax department) claimed property tax on the property in question on the ground that since the lease could be further extended for a period of 30 years, thus, it was a lease in perpetuity, upon which property tax could be levied (in terms of Ss.4(a) & (b) of [Sindh] Urban Immoveable Property Tax Act, 1958---Validity---Perusal of lease deed showed that period of lease was thirty years, and on the expiry of such period the superstructure raised by the lessee was to vest with the Board without payment of any compensation whatsoever to the lessee---Such condition was quite cardinal and pivotal for determination of the nature of the lease in, in that, it was not perpetual, rather the return of the superstructure in the ownership of the Board made the lease in the nature of a Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) contract---Only for the reason that there was a clause for renewal in the lease deed for a further period of thirty years, regardless of whether renewal had been factually granted or not, which otherwise seemed to be the exclusive privilege of the Board and lessee could not claim it as a matter of right, lease in question could not be held to be one in perpetuity---Besides, lessee was not free to raise construction at his own free will, but only with the prior approval of the Chairman of the Board---Subletting/sub-lease of the constructed property had also been subjected to the approval of the concerned Administrator of the Board and in any case, such sub-lease could not travel beyond the period of thirty years i.e. the original lease period---Rights of the lessee had been restricted in that, he was not allowed to either mortgage or alienate or encumber the leased out property---Moreover, it was clearly and unequivocally stipulated in the lease deed that breach of any of the conditions of the lease shall make the lease liable to be cancelled at the prerogative of the lessor and the lessor shall have authority to evict the lessee---When all said stipulations of the lease deed were read as a whole, they militated against the concept of lease in perpetuity---Supreme Court directed that since lease in question was not in perpetuity, therefore, the Tax department had no lawful authority to demand/levy property tax from the lessee in term of Ss.4(a) & (b) of [Sindh] Urban Immoveable Property Tax Act, 1958---Supreme Court observed that present opinion (judgment) shall neither apply nor be relevant for the grants and the leases pertaining to and made in the cantonment areas, or border areas etc., as the court did not have the privilege and advantage of examining such transactions and the relevant law, the rules and the policies applicable thereto under which those (leases) had been given---Appeal was dismissed accordingly.
