Versus
SAFEER JAN---Respondent
Civil Appeal No. 1127 of 2011, decided on 5th November, 2019.
(Against judgment dated 26.05.2009 passed by the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar in T.R. No. 85 of 2007)
Income Tax Ordinance (XXXI of 1979) [since repealed]---

----S. 12(18)---Income chargeable to tax---Scope---Partnership firm---Gift deeds---Whether gift amounts received by one partner from other partners in the firm/AOP (Association of persons) could be added by the tax officer under S. 12(18) of the erstwhile Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 ('the Ordinance')---Held, that plain reading of S. 12(18) of the Ordinance showed that the said provision was attracted when loans, advances and gifts were received in cash---In the present case, however, admittedly, no cash exchanged hands---Members of the partnership firm/AOP had only authorized the respondent-partner to withdraw a certain amount from their share in the AOP; as such no cash had been paid or received, which fact had clearly been mentioned in the gift deeds executed between the partners---Transaction was ex facie reflected in book entries made in the records of the AOP---Further, the language of the gift deeds was clear that the amount gifted was liable to be withdrawn by the donee (respondent) from the share of donors in the AOP, which further lent support to the finding that only a right was given to the respondent to withdraw the amounts in question from time to time from the share of the donors in the AOP and that no transaction which could be interpreted as immediate and actual transfer of funds had taken place---Provisions of S. 12(18) of the Ordinance were not attracted in the present case---Appeal was dismissed.
