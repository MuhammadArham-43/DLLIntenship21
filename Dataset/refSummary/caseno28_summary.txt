----S. 8(3)---Workers' Welfare Fund (Employees Service) Rules, 1997---Constitution of Pakistan, Art. 199---Employees of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Workers Welfare Board (Employees)---Statutory rules of service---Workers' Welfare Fund (Employees Service) Rules, 1997 were applicable with full statutory force to the service of the employees of the Workers' Welfare Board of the Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa---Moreover after the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, said Rules enacted by the Federal Government were exclusively within the domain of the Provincial Government/Provincial Workers' Welfare Board---Employees could file a Constitutional petition before the High Court if there was any invasion on their service benefits and rights by the authorities.

Workers' Welfare Fund (Employees Service) Rules, 1997 enacted by the Federal Government were adopted and made applicable to the Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with clear directions and express approval of the Federal Government. For all intents and purposes said Rules had become applicable with full statutory force to the service and terms and conditions of service etc. of the employees of the Workers Welfare Board of the Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Before the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, Ministry of Labour was within the domain of the Federal Government and once under its approval and direction the Workers Welfare Board has adopted the Workers' Welfare Fund (Employees Service) Rules, 1997, regulating the terms and conditions of service of its employees. After the Eighteenth Amendment, said Rules were exclusively within the domain of the Provincial Government/Workers' Welfare Board and unless the same was amended, repealed, modified or re-enacted under the changed Constitutional scenario, the same had a binding statutory force and the services of the employees of the Workers' Welfare Board of the Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, were squarely and undoubtedly regulated by the said Rules. Till date said Rules had neither been repealed nor amended in any manner by the Provincial Government or for that matter by the Provincial Assembly of the Province.

Services of the employees of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Workers' Welfare Board were fully protected by the statutory rules, and any invasion on their service benefits and rights by the authorities entitled them to approach the High Court through a Constitutional petition.
