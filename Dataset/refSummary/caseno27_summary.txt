Per Ijaz ul Ahsan, J; Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, CJ agreeing; Faisal Arab, J dissenting only to the extent of Rule 7(3) of the Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005

(a) Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) Ordinance (IV of 1984)---

----S. 7A [as amended by the Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) (Amendment) Act, (VIII of 2017)]---Not-for-profit private schools in province of Punjab---Academic fees, increase in---Cap on increase in school fees under S. 7A of the Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) Ordinance, 1984 ('the Ordinance') was also applicable to not-for-profit schools---Said Ordinance did not contain any such distinction between for-profit and not-for-profit schools---Had the Legislature intended to create such distinction, it would have specifically mentioned so---Applying the settled rules of interpretation, something which was conspicuously absent could not be read into the Ordinance---Only schools exempt from such limitation/cap were those charging monthly fees from a class of students at a rate which was less than four thousand rupees per month inclusive of the increase in fee.

(b) Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005---

----Rr. 7(3) & 7(4)---Private schools in province of Sindh---Tuition fees, increase in---Cap on increase in fees under R. 7 of the Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005 (the Rules')---Said cap was not limited only to tuition fees as the lawmaker had not specifically used the word 'tuition fee' and instead used the word 'fee'---Interpreting 'fee' to mean 'tuition fee' only, would render the parts of the R. 7 redundant as it would open the possibility of institutions misusing R. 7(4) to exorbitantly increase any fee other than tuition fee in order to compensate for the reduction in income as a result of the cap, thereby essentially extracting tuition fee under the garb of a new head under R. 7(4)---Rule 7(4) seemed to apply to situations where institutions wished to add any new fee head to their fee structure/schedule subject to the approval of the Registering Authority---Once a new head was added, it too, would be subject to the conditions that it shall not be increased at any time during the academic year and only up to five percent of the last fee schedule, subject to proper justification and approval of the Registering Authority---Supreme Court directed that institutions were to ensure that all the conditions of admission and the approved fee schedule were printed on the prospectus or on the admission form and provided to the parents or guardians of students at the time of the admission, and that admission fee was charged from the student only at the time of his first admission into the institution which shall not be more than three months' tuition fees of the respective class in which the student was admitted.

(c) Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005---

----R. 7(4)---Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Ordinance, 2001 (II of 2002), Preamble---Private schools in province of Sindh---Fee, charges or voluntary donation charged by institutions on account of any development project/activity---Costs of 'development project' and 'development activity'---Meaning---Such costs were to be borne by the institution---Since the terms 'development project' and 'development activity' had not been defined either in the Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Ordinance, 2001, or the Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005, as per the settled canons of interpretation, they shall be construed in accordance with their ordinary meaning which were projects or activities pertaining to construction, redevelopment, reconstruction, or rehabilitation of an institution's facilities.

(d) Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005---

----R. 10---Private schools in province of Sindh---Minimum salary and allowances of a full-time teacher with twelve months of continuous service---Scope---Minimum salary of teachers under R. 10 of the Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005 ('the Rules') was not a blanket rule as conditions had been provided in R. 10 itself---First, it was not only the salary but salary combined with allowances which must not be less than four times the monthly fee of a single student of the highest class charged by the institution; secondly, said rule only applied to full time teachers with twelve months of continuous service; and, thirdly, institutions run by trusts or communities were excluded from such requirement as they were only required to ensure that the pay scale of their teaching staff was at par with the respective Government pay scales.

(e) Constitution of Pakistan---

----Art. 18---Freedom of trade, business or profession---Scope---Reasonable restrictions---Scope of Art. 18 of the Constitution and reasonable restrictions thereon as laid down by the Superior Courts stated.

Following is the scope of Article 18 of the Constitution and reasonable restrictions thereon as laid down by the superior Courts:

i. Article 18 conferred upon a citizen a right to freedom of trade, business or professions which was designed to enable the citizen to explore and adopt the best for his future, means of living and earning, and for the expression and recognition of his skills and abilities;

ii. However, said right was not absolute, unqualified or unfettered, but subject to regulation and reasonable restrictions which may be imposed by law in the larger interests of the society or for public welfare;

iii. The word 'qualification' had been used to confer a right upon a citizen to enter upon any lawful profession or occupation and not, to conduct any unlawful trade or business;

iv. The word 'lawful' qualified the right of the citizen in the relevant field and envisaged that the State could by 1aw ban a profession, occupation, trade or business by declaring it to be unlawful which in common parlance meant anything forbidden by law;

v. The provisions that a citizen 'possessing such qualifications, if any, as may be provided by law' and 'the regulation of any trade or profession by a system of licensing' empowered the Legislature and the authorities concerned to impose restrictions on the exercise of the right;

vi. Although 'reasonable restrictions' did not feature in Article 18, this did not mean that imposition of unreasonable restrictions was permissible under the Constitution;

vii. Licensing system was itself a restraint on trade, but the Constitution empowered the Government to impose reasonable restrictions. Reasonable restrictions authorized by the Constitution did not negate the Constitutional rights of a citizen to do business unhindered, without any condition;

viii. A reasonable classification was always considered to be within the framework of the fundamental right;

ix. The measure of reasonableness in the Constitution was provided by the concept of 'regulation', thus the restrictions should be consistent with the purpose of 'regulation' and not so unreasonable as to be in excess of it;

x. Reasonable restriction did not mean prohibition or prevention completely;

xi. If restrictions were to be imposed to regulate such trade or business, those should not be arbitrary or excessive in nature, barring a majority of persons to enjoy such trade;

xii. The restriction must be reasonable and bear true relation to 'trade' or 'profession' and for the purposes of promoting general welfare;

xiii. By qualifying the right to business and trade, the Constitution makers wanted to create a balance between the societal needs and the rights of an individual;

xiv. Under the Constitution, a proper balance was intended to be maintained between the exercise of the right conferred by Article 18 of the Constitution and the interests of the citizen in the exercise of his right to acquire, hold or dispose of his property to carry on occupation, trade or business. In striking that balance the danger which may be inherent in permitting unfettered exercise of a right must of necessity influence the determination of the restrictions which may be placed upon the right of the citizen;

xv. The validity of the prescribed qualifications or restrictions could be examined by the superior Courts in exercise of the power of judicial review on the touchstone of other fundamental rights, including Article 18 and other provisions of the Constitution and the law;

xvi. It must be shown in a concrete manner as to how the restrictions imposed were in excess of the object or the actual limits of regulation; and

xvii. If the restrictions appeared to be not only arbitrary but oppressive in nature and tended to deprive the citizens from enjoying the fundamental right of freedom of trade and business as per Article 18 of the Constitution, then it became the Court's duty to see the nature of the restrictions and procedure prescribed therein for regulating the trade and if it came to the conclusion that the restrictions were not reasonable then the same were bound to be struck down.

(f) Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) Ordinance (IV of 1984)---

----Preamble---Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Ordinance, 2001 (II of 2002), Preamble---Constitution of Pakistan, Art. 18---Private education service industry---Business and trade within the meaning of Art. 18 of the Constitution---Regulation by licensing---Private educational services industry constituted 'business' under Art. 18 of the Constitution which was like any commercial activity for provision of services---Private educational services industry also constituted 'trade' and therefore could be subject to regulation by a licensing system under proviso (a) to Art. 18 of the Constitution.

(g) Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) Ordinance (IV of 1984)---

----S. 7A [as amended by the Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) (Amendment) Act, 2017]---Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005, R. 7(3)---Constitution of Pakistan, Arts. 9, 18, 23, 24 & 25A---Private schools---Cap on increase in school fees under S. 7A of the Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) Ordinance, 1984 and R. 7(3) of the Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005---Vires of---[Per Ijaz ul Ahsan, J (Majority view): While the citizens of the country had the right to conduct business relating to the private educational services industry in order to earn money, such right was not absolute or unfettered---By virtue of a licensing system, the State was empowered to regulate the exercise of such right and hence, could impose certain restrictions---Power to regulate included the power to regulate and control prices and matters related and incidental thereto---Such power had to be exercised fairly and reasonably and was justiciable on the touchstone inter alia of being unreasonable or arbitrary, the onus being on the person alleging un-reasonability or arbitrariness---Impugned laws in the Provinces of Punjab and Sindh [i.e. Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) Ordinance, 1984 and Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005, respectively] both aimed to give the Government control over unrecognized private educational institutions by providing for a system of registration and to regulate various matters relating to private educational institutions including, but not limited to, school fees and staff salaries by the respective Government or Registering Authorities---Said laws had been put in place to curb the tendency on the part of private education sector to generate disproportionately large amounts of profit at the expense of students and their parents, as indicated by the Auditor General's report, through exploitation of the unfortunate situation where high quality education was scarce due to lack of resources or initiative on behalf of the State, therefore, it could not be said that these laws were akin to punishing the private sector for the delinquency of the State in providing education to the children of the country---Restrictions put in place by the impugned laws aimed to strike a balance between the exercise of the right to conduct business in the educational services industry by citizens on the one hand and the interests of the community, i.e. the students enrolled in private educational institutions and their parents and teachers, on the other---Furthermore, the restrictions placed by the impugned laws did not constitute complete prohibition or prevention---Revenue cap regulation was not a concept unknown to legal system of Pakistan---Whole purpose of revenue cap regulation was to limit the total amount of revenue that a firm operating in a particular industry with no or very few competitors could earn---In economic theory, such regulation was employed as an incentive to reach a desired outcome for society which in the present case was the provision of education that was accessible and did not become inaccessible by virtue of exorbitant and unreasonable increase in school fees---While such regulation could be adopted by governments and regulators in any industry, this was true more so for utilities and essential services that were intrinsically linked to fundamental rights in which the objective was availability and affordability of the utility or service while ensuring quality---In the present case, it was the right to education which was in issue and which had been recognized as a fundamental right under Arts. 9 & 25A of the Constitution---State had a duty to guarantee such right which it was aiming to do through revenue cap regulation---Private schools had not been able to show in a concrete and material manner as to how the cap on increase in fees had transgressed constitutional principles or was in excess of the object or the actual limits of the regulation---Since the schools failed to show that the impugned laws prima facie violated the right under Art. 18 of the Constitution as being outside the scope of reasonable restrictions, the burden never shifted onto the State to show that the said laws came within the permissible limits of reasonable restrictions---In the facts and circumstances of the case, the restriction in the form of caps in increase of fees was not unreasonable---Section 7A of the Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) Ordinance, 1984, as amended by the Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) (Amendment) Act, 2017 was intra vires the Constitution and did not violate Arts. 18, 23, 24 or 25A thereof---Similarly R. 7(3) of the Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005 did not merit any interference---[Per Faisal Arab, J, dissenting only to the extent of R. 7(3) of the Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005 (Minority view): Only object of the law should be to check profiteering after students were admitted in schools, but when the fee of any particular service was regulated in a manner that had the potential of gradually eating-up legitimate margins of profit, it made businesses compromise on their quality lest they would run into losses which in turn led to layoffs or their eventual closure---To allow increase in tuition fee was not something that was to be equated with some concession or benefit granted by the State as it was mainly intended to compensate for the diminution in the purchasing power of currency of the country---Revision in tuition fee should be solely intended to meet the ever increasing cost of running of a school and at the same time persevering reasonable margin of profit---Limiting the raise in school fees to 5% only under R. 7(3) of the Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005 ('the 2005 Rules'), would be too harsh a financial restriction as it did not fully take care of the cost of running a school in comparison to the cost of its previous academic year---Such fact was evident from the value which the currency of the country had consistently been shedding in any five year period---Looking from such angle too, the arbitrarily determined cap of 5% imposed under R. 7(3) would certainly act as an unreasonable restriction on carrying on a lawful business---Inbuilt cumbersome process to seek increase in tuition fee under R. 7(3) also amounted to unreasonable restriction---In view of the arbitrary cap of 5% increase in fee imposed by R. 7(3), there was a strong possibility that many of the private schools in Sindh at a certain point in time may not be able to fully absorb the increase in the cost of running a school or the cost of the facilities provided to the students---Consequently the existing private schools may start closing down or the number of their branches may dwindle which in turn would make it very difficult to cope with the ever increasing demand for good quality educational institutions---In the present case no one had argued that any cartel existed that did not leave much choice with the parents but to admit their children in a particular set of school systems only, therefore, there existed no monopoly in the fixation of tuition fees---Raising the cap of 5% provided in R. 7(3) to an automatic increase upto 8% in an academic year without recourse to Registering Authority would bring it closer to the ground realities and within the limits of reasonableness and at the same time save the department and the schools much of the inconvenience in the periodical revision of tuition fees---His Lordship directed the [Sindh] Provincial Government to amend R. 7(3) of the Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005 accordingly within a period of two months]

(i) Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) Ordinance (IV of 1984)---

----S. 7A [as amended by the Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) (Amendment) Act, 2017]---Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005, R. 7(3)---Private schools---Cap on increase in school fees under S. 7A of the Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) Ordinance, 1984 and R. 7(3) of the Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005---Directions given by the Supreme Court with respect to cap on increase in school fees provided.

Following are the directions given by the Supreme Court with respect to cap on increase in school fees:

(i) Through an interim order dated 30-12-2018 the Supreme Court had directed all educational institutions receiving fees in excess of Rs.5,000/- per month to reduce their fee by 20%. Said amounts equivalent to 20% of fee(reduced under the interim order) or any other amount shall not be recovered as arrears for any reason or under any circumstances.

(ii) Since schools had excessively increased fees since the year 2017 in violation of the law, all such increases were to be struck down. It would be deemed that there was no increase in fee since 2017 and fees were frozen at the rates prevailing in January, 2017.

(iii) Schools fees should be recalculated using the fee prevailing in 2017 as the base fee in accordance with the provisions of the Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) Ordinance, 1984 and the Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005, respectively (adding annual increases permitted by the law/rules/regulations) till 2019 and onwards. The process of recalculation shall be supervised by the regulators and only the fee approved by them shall be treated as the chargeable fee.

(iv) Any excess fee found to have been charged shall be adjusted in the future fee.

(v) The Regulators shall closely monitor the fee being charged by private schools to ensure strict compliance with the law and the rules/regulations. Complaint cells shall be setup to deal with complaints arising out of increase in fee in violation of the law/rules/regulations.

(vi) All schools shall collect the fees, strictly in accordance with the procedure and timeframe provided by the law, the rules and regulations including, but not limited to the Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) Ordinance, 1984, as amended by the Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) (Amendment) Act, 2017 and the Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005.
