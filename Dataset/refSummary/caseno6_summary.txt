----S. 6---Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited Staff Regulations, 2005---Agricultural Development Bank (Staff Service) Regulations, 1961---Promotion Policy, 1999---Constitution of Pakistan, Art. 199---Legislation by reference---Scope---Bank employee---Promotion of employees in service of Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (Bank) prior to the promulgation of Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (Reorganization and Conversion) Ordinance, 2002---Promotion Committee of Bank not recommending promotion of such employees on the basis that they failed to meet the threshold required for promotion under the applicable Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited Staff Regulations, 2005, and that their promotion was not governed by the Agricultural Development Bank (Staff Service) Regulations, 1961 or by Promotion Policy, 1999---Employees challenged recommendations of Promotion Committee by filing constitutional petition before High Court claiming that their promotion was governed by Agricultural Development Bank (Staff Service) Regulations, 1961 and Promotion Policy, 1999 and not by the Regulations of 2005---Maintainability---Contention of Bank was that even if employees in question were governed by Agricultural Development Bank (Staff Service) Regulations, 1961 and Promotion Policy, 1999, the same were non-statutory, therefore, constitutional petition would not be maintainable---Validity---Section 6 of Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (Reorganization and Conversion) Ordinance, 2002 provided two fold security to employees who were in service of the Bank prior to the promulgation of the said Ordinance: Firstly the employees of the Bank, prior to promulgation of said Ordinance, stood transferred and became employees of the Company, and secondly they were made subject to the same rules and regulations as were applicable to them before the promulgation of the said Ordinance---On account of S.6 of the said Ordinance, the previous Regulations relating to promotion of employees in question, i.e. Agricultural Development Bank (Staff Service) Regulations, 1961 and Promotion Policy, 1999, which were non-statutory, stood incorporated by way of legislative reference and thereby acquired a statutory status under the new dispensation and the employees acquired a legal right for their enforcement---Constitutional petition before High Court, filed against recommendations of Promotion Committee, would be maintainable in such circumstances---Appeal filed by Bank was dismissed accordingly.

(b) Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (Reorganization and Conversion) Ordinance (LX of 2002)---

 

----S. 6---Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited Staff Regulations, 2005, Para. 14(h)---Agricultural Development Bank (Staff Service) Regulations, 1961---Promotion Policy, 1999---Promotion of employees in service of Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (Bank) prior to the promulgation of Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (Reorganization and Conversion) Ordinance, 2002---Promotion Committee of Bank not recommending promotion of such employees on the basis that they failed to meet the threshold required for promotion under the Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited Staff Regulations, 2005---Employees challenged recommendations of Promotion Committee by filing constitutional petition before High Court claiming that their promotion was not governed by the Regulations of 2005 but by the Agricultural Development Bank (Staff Service) Regulations, 1961 and Promotion Policy, 1999---High Court allowed the constitutional petition holding that promotion of employees was not governed by the procedure provided in the Regulations of 2005 and directed the Bank to send cases of employees to the Promotion Committee for consideration afresh in accordance with the same rules and regulations which were applicable to them prior to the promulgation of Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (Reorganization and Conversion) Ordinance, 2002---Bank contended that Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited Staff Regulations, 2005 were voluntarily and consciously adopted by the employees who took all the monetary benefits under it, and after sitting/participating in the competitive process for promotion as contemplated by Paragraph 14(h) of the Regulations of 2005 and after failing to meet the threshold required for promotion, the employees were estopped by their own conduct from turning around and claiming promotion on the basis of the previously applicable Agricultural Development Bank (Staff Service) Regulations, 1961 or Promotion Policy, 1999---Validity---By virtue of S.6 of Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (Reorganization and Conversion) Ordinance, 2002, employees in question acquired a statutory right to be considered for promotion in accordance with the same rules and regulations which were applicable to them before the promulgation of said Ordinance---Employees in question, therefore, were to be considered for promotion in terms of Agricultural Development Bank (Staff Service) Regulations, 1961 and Promotion Policy, 1999, which admittedly was not done by the Promotion Committee in the present case---Contention of Bank that employees in question having derived all monetary benefits under Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited Staff Regulations, 2005 were estopped from claiming promotion under previously applicable rules and regulations, was not tenable, Firstly because there was no estoppel against law; secondly, no document had been placed on record to indicate that the option (of monetary benefits) was exercised voluntary and even if it was, it would not prevent employees from seeking enforcement of the procedure laid down in Regulations for promotions which were in vogue prior to the promulgation of Ordinance of 2002; thirdly, employees challenged the entire impugned process at the earliest before formal orders could take effect, and fourthly the monetary benefits received by the employees could be adjusted by the Bank if so advised---Appeal filed by Bank was dismissed accordingly.

(c) Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (Reorganization and Conversion) Ordinance (LX of 2002)---

 

----S. 6--- Legislation by reference--- Scope--- Section 6 of Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (Reorganization and Conversion) Ordinance, 2002 was an instance of legislation by reference.

 

(d) Legislation---

 

----Legislation by reference---Scope---Legislation by referential incorporation fell into two categories; first, where a statute by specific reference incorporated the provisions of another statute as of the time of adoption; second, where a statute incorporated by general reference the law concerning a particular subject as a genus---In the case of former category, the subsequent amendment made in the referred statute could not automatically be read into the adoption statute---In the case of latter category, it might be presumed that the legislative intent was to include all the subsequent amendments also made from time to time in the general law on the subject adopted by general reference.

 

Wood's Estate case [1886] 31 Ch D 607 and Rajya v. Gopikabai AIR 1979 SC 79 ref.

 

(e) Interpretation of statutes---

 

----Legislation by reference---Scope---Statute which referred to law of a subject generally adopted the law on the subject as of the time the law was invoked; and this would include all the amendments and modifications of the law subsequent to the time the reference/statute was enacted.

 

Rajya v. Gopikabai AIR 1979 SC 79 ref.

 

(f) Delegated legislation---

 

----Rules and regulations framed under an Act by statutory bodies---Scope---Rules and regulations framed under any Act were meant to regulate and limit the statutory authority---All statutory authorities or bodies derived their powers from statutes which created them and from the rules or regulations framed thereunder---Any order passed or action taken which was in derogation or in excess of the powers of statutory authority or body, could be assailed as ultra vires---Statutory bodies were invariably authorized under the Act to make or adopt rules and regulations not inconsistent with the Act, with respect to such matters which fell within their lawful domain to carry out the purposes of the Act.

 

(g) Delegated legislation---

 

----Reasons justifying need for delegated legislation---Firstly, there is pressure on parliamentary time; secondly, the technicality of subject matter necessitates prior consultation and expert advice on interests concerned, and thirdly, the need for flexibility is established because it is not possible to foresee every administrative difficulty that may arise to make adjustment that may be called for after the statute has begun to operate.
