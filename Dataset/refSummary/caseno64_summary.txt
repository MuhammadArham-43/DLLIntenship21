Civil Appeals Nos. 1406 and 1407 of 2016, decided on 27th October, 2017.
(On appeal from the judgment dated 04.02.2016 of the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar passed in I.C.As. Nos. 6 and 7 of 2012)
(a) Interpretation of statutes---

----Words appearing in a section (of a statute) were to be read in the context in which they were used.

In the matter of the Rev. James Godfrey MacManaway PLD 1950 PC 149 ref.

(b) Interpretation of statutes---

----Reference to dictionary meaning of a word---Propriety---Reading words into an Act unless it was absolutely necessary to do so was contrary to all rules of construction---Reference to dictionaries by the judges, without first examining the statutory provision and its context, was inappropriate---Such an approach may result in incorporating into the legislation something which it did not contain, and what the Legislature did not intend.

(c) Companies Act (XIX of 2017)---

----S. 2(1)(50)---Promoter of a company---Definition and meaning.

(d) Companies Act (XIX of 2017)---

----S. 2(1)(50)---'Promoter'---Fiduciary duty---Scope---Promoters of a company, in the context of company law, stood in fiduciary relationship to it---Promoters had in their hands the creation and moulding of the company; they had the power of defining how, and when, and in what shape, and under what supervision, it shall start into existence and begin to act as a trading corporation---Two fiduciary duties imposed on a promoter were; first, not to make a secret profit out of the promotion of the company without the company's consent; and second to disclose to the company any interest which he had in a transaction entered into by it.

(e) Companies Ordinance (XLVII of 1984) [since replaced by the Companies Act (XIX of 2017)]---

----Ss. 412 & 413---Delinquent conduct of directors of a company causing it to go into liquidation---State Bank of Pakistan and Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, liability of---Scope---Authority which incorporated or regulated companies or a central bank were not the promoters of a company---Role of a regulator of companies and a central bank was altogether different from the promoters of a company envisaged in S. 412 of the Companies Ordinance, 1984---Liability under Ss. 412 & 413 of the Ordinance attached when there was misapplication or retention of the money or property of the company or any misfeasance or breach of trust in relation to the company---Section 412 of the Ordinance stipulated that, if a person had misapplied, retained, committed misfeasance or breach of trust with regard to any money or property of the company he was liable to restore it, whereas S. 413 of the Ordinance provided that if the business of the company was conducted with intent to defraud creditors of the company or any other person, or for any other fraudulent purpose then those who knowingly did so were personally responsible for the debts or other liabilities incurred as a consequence---Statutory regulatory body, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), and a central bank established by statute, such as State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), could not be deemed to commit the illegal acts mentioned in the Ss. 412 & 413 of the Ordinance---Phrases, taken part in the promotion or formation of a company (in section 412 of the Ordinance) and carrying out any business of the company (in section 413 of the Ordinance) did not include the regulator of companies, regulatory authorities or a central bank---Moreover Ss. 412 & 413 of the Ordinance did not mention SBP or SECP particularly nor referred to regulatory authorities and/or a central bank generally---Sections 412 & 413 of the Ordinance were penal provisions, and penal provisions could not be given an extended meaning to include the State Bank of Pakistan and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan.

(f) Interpretation of statutes---

----Penal provision---Such a provision was to be construed strictly---Where any penal provision was susceptible to two or more interpretations then the one which did not extend the penalty/liability was to be preferred to one that did.

(h) Interpretation of statutes---

----Statute dealing with companies---Any word or phrase in such a statute was to be read and understood in the context of the particular section and then in the context of the statute, and, if its meaning remained ambiguous then reference to judicial precedents on company law and legal treatise on company law explaining the said word or phrase may be had, however, if the meaning still eluded one then legal dictionaries and English language dictionaries could be examined.
